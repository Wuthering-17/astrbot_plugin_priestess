"""Turn a 小黑盒 (Heybox) Endfield "抽卡分析" overview into gacha rows the official API can no longer give.

Heybox keeps an aggregate per pool: total pulls, the current pity, every 6-star with its exact
time and the number of pulls it took (`diff`), and the 5-stars pulled in between (name + count).
It does not keep each 4-star. For a period our database has no official rows for, the pulls are
rebuilt so that counts, 6-stars and pity are exact:

  - the 6-star row carries the real name and second;
  - the 5-stars of the segment carry real names, at an unknown position inside the segment;
  - every other pull is a placeholder row (PLACEHOLDER_NAME, 4-star).

Rebuilt rows get a negative `pos` (official seqIds are positive), so they can never collide with
official rows and can be told apart or removed at any time. Official rows are never modified:
a pool is only extended backwards, and only when the overlap between the two sources agrees.

Heybox also reports the last official seqId it has seen per pool type. Official rows newer than
that are pulls made after its snapshot: they are left out of the comparison, so the same snapshot
gives the same answer whenever the plan is rebuilt (see `reconcile` in __init__.py).

Pure functions: no I/O, no database.
