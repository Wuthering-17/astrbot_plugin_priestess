"""Equipment builds of bound members' operators, for the usage statistics on the wiki cards.

The game has no table of recommended equipment, so the cards show what members actually run.
Once a day the collection (echoes.EchoStore.collect) also reads each member's Skland card and
keeps, per operator at MIN_LEVEL or above, the four equipped pieces, their sets and how far each
of a piece's three attributes was refined (精锻). Only aggregates are shown: how many members run
which set on an operator, the most common piece per slot for each of the most used sets, and the
average refinement of each attribute on that piece. Members who opted out of the statistics are neither fetched nor counted.
