## Game data and assets

Operator, weapon, stage, enemy, activity and gacha pool data are downloaded at runtime from
AKEData (https://www.akedata.wiki/) and from Skland; they are not stored in this repository.
Arknights activity and gacha pool times are downloaded at runtime from
yuanyan3060/ArknightsGameResource (https://github.com/yuanyan3060/ArknightsGameResource) and from
the public API of PRTS Wiki (https://prts.wiki/, content under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0); they are not stored
in this repository either. The banners shown in the activity calendar are fetched at runtime as well:
Endfield activity pictures from AKEData, Endfield pool banners from the game's own pool page, and
Arknights activity and pool banners from PRTS Wiki. They are cached locally and never committed.
The screenshots under `docs/images/` and `plugins/skl_help/help.webp` contain names and artwork from
Arknights and Arknights: Endfield, which are the property of their respective rights holders and
are shown only to illustrate the bot's output.
